To install the abused daemon open a terminal and run:

cd <path-to-downloaded-files>/install
sudo ./install.sh

To uninstall the abused daemon:

cd <path-to-downloaded-files>/install
sudo ./install.sh uninstall


What the install process does is:
 -compile the executable
 -copy the executable to /usr/local/bin
 -copy the init.d script (for boot startup)
 -configure for start boot on runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5

The uninstall process undoes the steps the install process does.
