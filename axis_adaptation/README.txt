  Prepare the MySQL database
  --------------------------


  1. Copy the contents of both folders into your webroot
     or a subfolder in the webroot.
     Example:

     mkdir /var/www/abused
     cd <path_to_abused>/axis_adaptation
     cp www/* /var/www/abused
     cp sql/* /var/www/abused

  2. Navigate to the install.php script in your favorite browser
     and follow the on-screen instructions.
     Http link:

     http://<ip_of_abused_host>/abused/install.php

  3. Continue to building and installing the abused daemon
     if you haven't already done so.
